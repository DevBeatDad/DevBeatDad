**NOTE**: It really bugged me that this section was left blank (by me - Mr TakingFullResponsibility over here) 
for so long so I used Github's suggestions for what to put here.


* Dumela, I’m DevBeatDad

       I understand your want and/or near need to know why I went for this moniker, so I hope this will satiate 
       that desire:

       It's personal and will likely be changed (by me) to something similar but different in an arbitrary but 
       significant way in future. (Ha ha)

* I’m interested in:
  
       * Music (recording, production and post (mixing and mastering)) and Sound (Recording (on location 
       and/or in studio), and post (I mainly do final mix but I also do sound design )).
  
      * Computer Science (Seems to have similar principles to sound engineering: signal flow, processing 
      of said signal/s - in fact, the digital part of sound engineering wouldn't exist without computer science. 
      I hope my appreciation for both fields is at _least_ palpable)

      * Social Dynamics (animals, especially their interactions with each other, fascinate me - humans are 
      * no different)
 
* I’m currently learning:
  
    * Computer Science (in a rather circuitous way), starting with:

      * Web Development:

            Python (I know I can, and will use it for more than 
            just wweb development,but that's what I intend to use it for first ... Or mostly ... At least initially)

            HTML

            CSS (UX, am I right?!?!)

            Javascript

            Markdown


* I’m looking to collaborate on:

        - Anything that is likely to help me learn and/or help increase my expertise (ten thousand hours starts 
          somewhere, right?) in the aforementioned interests section and learning areas.
